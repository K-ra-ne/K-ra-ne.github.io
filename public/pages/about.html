    <h2>A Boy Who Couldn't Sit Still</h2>
        <hr>
            <p>
                My name is Dakota Viney and I have witnessed 1,867 full moons.
                I was born during the Spring of 1995 in a small town in the Iron Range
                and adopted by my Maternal grandparents. I grew up with a passion for Animal
                Biology, Computers, and Music; on over 50 acres of wooded swamps. I truly
                believe my after life will consist of the laughter of my Wife and Children,
                the combing, chirping, and creaking of frogs, surrounded by fireflies,
                while being embraced by a light warm breeze.

    <h2>The Casino Life for Me</h2>
        <hr>
            <p>
                My first job was as a Cashier at the local Holiday gas station. I then began
                with my Dad maintaining the local Fair Grounds during the Summer and attending
                the Ice Skating Rink when Winter would hit. I did this along with jumping
                generic job to generic job from 2012 to the Winter of 2016.
                February of 2017, I had heard that a friend of mine had gotten a job
                as a Security Guard at one of the tribal Casinos in the Area. I figured,
                "Hell, if he could get that job, there is no way I couldn't!"
                I had one short interview with a man named Joe, and walked out with a job.
            <br>
            <br>
                 Quickly,  I had become exceedingly bored and had put in an 
                 internal transfer to work as a Slot Attendant which led to becoming
                 Slot Technician (as well as meeting my Wife) and eventually, leaving the Casino in the Winter of 2019 to work
                 at one of the other tribal Casinos in the area. It was a far smaller Casino and 
                 was run like it as well. Feeling dissatisfied, I left and began once again jumping 
                 from one soul crushing job to the other.

    <h2>A Nasty Little Bug</h2>
        <hr>
            <p>
                I remember when I had left the small Casino, my Wife and I had 
                come down with a <b>NASTY</b> respiratory infection. I couldn't smell
                or taste, I felt as though I had a person sitting on my chest, and
                was just exhausted all of the time like I had the Flu. Then my wife caught
                it as well. It was like a bad cold.. but far worse.
            <br>
            <br>
                Not long after that, the first cases of Corona Virus infections had began being
                reported on in the Media and ended up with the dreaded "Lock Down". During this time there were all sorts of perks for working
                "front line" jobs, and we were referred to work at this Group Home by 
                my wife's sister. We had applied and gotten the jobs! I didn't last long though,
                as I had been placed in the only violent House in the company and did not
                particularly enjoy being beamed by bulk canned Corn, hurled by a man with the
                mental capacity of a 5 year old and the strength to boot. I left and began working at Best Buy
                as well as Door Dashing for a short while. I also attempted to go back to School to
                 pursue a Network Admin bachelor's but that was a mess and a half, as well as a story for another time.

    <h2>It's Like Sin City, but Smaller</h2>
        <hr>
            <p>
                In April of 2021, while for all intents and purposes unemployed, depressed, and likely slightly drunk
                I noticed that Blackjack Dealer classes were being held at the original Casino
                which I had worked at. I applied and had the job.<br>
                After 2 weeks of paid training and a live audition, I was a proud new addition
                to the Table Games Department. By July I had applied for, and gotten, a Table Games
                Supervisor job.
            <br>
            <br>
                My combined time in the Casino had taught me a great amount about interacting with people
                from all walks of life especially ones I didn't necessarily like, professionalism,
                servant leadership, and how to actively seek betterment. All things that would come in handy
                come September of 2022 when my first Child was born. Which is when it became painfully obvious
                that, while I was being paid well compared to most people in my area, I was not being paid enough nor
                was I being valued. So, on a little bit of blind faith and encouragment from my wife, I found myself once more
                leaving the warm downy underside of the Casino's wings.
